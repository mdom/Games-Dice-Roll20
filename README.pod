=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $dice = Games::Dice::Roll20->new();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Games::Dice::Roll20 simulates dice rolls by using a syntax familiar to players
of role playing games. In contrast to many similar projects it does not only
support simple constructs like I<2d6+4> but aims to simulate complex dice
mechanics like exploding, re-rolling and keeping and dropping high or low dice.
It shoold be a almost complete implementation of the dice specification by
L<Roll20|https://wiki.roll20.net/Dice_Reference>. The supported features and
deviations from this specifications are listed in L<our own
specification|https://github.com/mdom/Games-Dice-Roll20/blob/master/lib/Games/Dice/Roll20/Spec.pod>.
